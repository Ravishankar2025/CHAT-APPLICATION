-Communication Model: Peer-to-peer or client-server communication (using WebSockets, HTTP/2, etc.).
-Use Cases: One-on-one messaging, group chats, file sharing, real-time notifications, and more.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication:
   - User login and registration via email, username, or social media accounts (OAuth integration).
   - Secure password management and token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth 2.0).

2. Real-Time Messaging:

   - Integration with cloud storage services (e.g., Firebase Storage, AWS S3).

5. Notifications:

   - Real-time alerts for important updates or announcements.

6. Message History:
   - Persistent chat history with search and filtering capabilities.
   - Archived conversations accessible even after users log out.

7. Security and Privacy:
   - End-to-end encryption to protect message content.
   - Data encryption for sensitive information.
